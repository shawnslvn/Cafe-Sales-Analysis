# Cafe-Sales-Analysis
In this project I took 10,000 rows of data and had to clean and impute data to get it ready for analysis. After the cleaning process was complete I exported the data and uploaded it into tableau. Then began to create charts and KPI's that coule be put on a dashboard to provide sales insights for the year.
